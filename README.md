# Time-Series-Forecasting for Quarterly Revenue Generation of State and Local Taxes
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on applying time series forecasting techniques to predict the quarterly revenue generation of State and Local Government Tax in the U.S. using data from 2009 to 2022. Multiple models are evaluated to determine the best forecasting method.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of quarterly tax revenue data from the U.S. Census Bureau. It covers the period from 2009 to 2022, with the target variable being tax revenue measured in millions of dollars.


**Objectives**
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and outliers.

Apply multiple time series forecasting models.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

Generate predictions for future tax revenue.

Methodology

**Data Preprocessing:**

Handle missing values.

Partition data into training (2009-2022) and validation (2023).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data trends and seasonality using plots.

**Modeling:**

Quadratic Trend Model

Quadratic Trend and Seasonality Model

Exponential Trend Model

ARIMA Model

Auto ARIMA Model

**Evaluation:**

Evaluate models using RMSE and MAPE metrics.

Compare accuracy to select the best model.

**Results**

The ARIMA model with seasonality was identified as the best-performing model, achieving an RMSE of 16504.35 and a MAPE of 2.30%.
